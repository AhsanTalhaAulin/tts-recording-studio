Build a web-based recording studio that allows two speakers to collaboratively record audio for a TTS dataset. The user should be able to upload conversation JSON files containing speaker-tagged sentences. These sentences will be queued and presented one at a time for recording. Each sentence should be recorded with a single click; the record button must toggle re-recording without requiring repeated microphone permission prompts. Display a real-time waveform that's sensitive to human speech and show elapsed time during recording. Enforce a visible 15-second recording limit. Store all recordings and metadata on the local filesystem. When new JSON files are uploaded, merge them with the existing dataset rather than replacing it. maintain three datasets: one for speaker 1, one for speaker 2, and one combined multi-speaker dataset, each with a wav/ directory and a metadata.csv file using the PiperTTS-compatible format. The multi-speaker metadata must include the speaker identifier. All data should persist across sessions.

use git, commit properly. 
everything should be dockerized
